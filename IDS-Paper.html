    <h1>History of DRM</h1>

    <h1> Overview of DRM Technology </h1>
    	<p> Digital Rights Management is a way to control access to copyrighted content on the web. There are a variety of methods of implementing DRM for software. There isn’t a ubiquitous DRM standard; companies use a variety of methods to protect their content. The whole point of DRM is to combat interoperability, so if the methods behind DRM were uniform, it would be easier to circumvent. However, many companies, such as Apple, Netflix, and Valve’s Steam, use varying forms of a key system. Essentially, the key system is using serializes codes as representations of a users’ individual license to access copyrighted content. (1) A common form of key-based DRM protection for MP3 files and DVDs is content scrambling.</p>
        <p> As an example of content scrambling DRM, we will look at Apple’s Fairplay DRM system. Although Apple’s music is now DRM-Free, other content such as movies, apps, eBooks, and film, are DRM protected. Each iTunes account is associated with an encrypted key that authorizes that particular machine to access the account. Apple stores this key and accompanying account information in an “encrypted key repository”. (3) As an extra protection, an account is limited to being authorized on no more than five machines. When a user purchases content on iTunes, a user key that is specific to that file is generated. The file’s data is scrambled, and an encrypted master key is generated for the specific file. Only the master key knows how to unscrambled the file data. This master key is then locked using the user key. Only the user’s key can decrypt the master key so it can unscramble the file data so that the app, eBook, or video can be viewed. (2)

    <h1> Related Principles </h1>
        <p> Principles we've studied in the class relate to the question of DRM for the Web.
        In many ways, DRM protections directly conflict with Metcalfe’s Law. This is because DRM limits the connections that can be made to content on the Internet. When Netflix or Amazon or Apple limits access to media using DRM protections, they are lessening the network effect of the Internet by making limiting the connections that users can make. When authors and artists alike publish work on the web, using DRM protections will limit the connections that their work could create. A book published for free online that can be shared and seen by anyone benefits the network effects of Metcalfe’s Law and also benefits the artist in that they have the potential to reach more viewers.</p>
        <p> In a variety of cases, pirated works, which are free of DRM protection, often lead to increased popularity of the work itself. A well-known benefactor of piracy is Game of Thrones, which is the most pirated show on the web today (4). HBO’s shows are not internationally available but pirated, DRM free episodes made the show accessible to audiences around the world, exponentially increasing its network connections. Metcalfe’s Law was certainly at work in this case, as word of mouth and buzz around the show helped elevate its popularity to reach audiences that were willing to pay to view the show. </p>
        <p> Piracy made the show accessible to audiences around the world. In fact, the CEO of Time Warner Jeff Bewes said in 2013 that “if you go to people who are watching it without subs, it's a tremendous word-of-mouth thing . . . We've been dealing with this for 20, 30 years—people sharing subs, running wires down the backs of apartment buildings. Our experience is that it leads to more paying subs.” Bewes then went as far as claiming that the fact that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world is “better than an Emmy." (5) </p>
        <p> O’Reilly Media Company, a media publishing site for eBook and websites relating to computer science, is committed to publishing DRM-free content. In an interview with the founder and CEO of the company, Tim O’Reilly, was asked whether or not he fears piracy of the site’s content. He responded: </p>
        </p>Let’s say my goal is to sell 10,000 copies of something. And let’s say that if by putting DRM in it I sell 10,000 copies and I make my money, and if by having no DRM 100,000 copies go into circulation and I still sell 10,000 copies. Which of those is the better outcome? I think having 100,000 in circulation and selling 10,000 is way better than having just the 10,000 that are paid for and nobody else benefits. (6) </p>
        <p> These are just two examples of the benefits of publishing DRM-free content. Had Time Warner initially cracked down harder on piracy, they may not have the widespread success and popularity that the Game of Thrones currently enjoys. By limiting the networks effect of content, the content itself may have a decreased likelihood of success and exposure. </p>
        <p> Bill Gates, for example, spoke optimistically of piracy at a speech in 1998, arguing that although many users don’t pay for Microsoft software, “Someday they will, though” and “And as long as they’re going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They’ll get sort of addicted, and then we’ll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.” </p>
