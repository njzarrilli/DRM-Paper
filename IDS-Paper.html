    <h1>History of DRM</h1>
    	<p> Digital Rights Management is, in theory, a way of protecting copyrighted content from being redistributed to those who did not purchase the rights to own this content. In 1998, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act “made it illegal to disable DRM systems or to spread information about how to disable them.” (26) While movie and television studios benefit from DRM and claim it protects artists and content producers from piracy, opposed groups claim it is ineffective at achieving this protection and instead restricts users and gives companies control over how, when, and on what devices they can view content. In 2013, the W3C drafted and ultimately published a standard in HTML5 for DRM-protected media, called Encrypted Media Extensions. Netflix, Microsoft, and Google all had supported this document, which fueled open software groups’ anger over the increasing influence of companies in the future of the web (26). The API that the W3C put forth allows encrypted audio and video content to be played directly through HTML5 rather than through an app or plugin, such as Silverlight. Those who support EME emphasize that this API does not directly support DRM but allows web browsers to “interact with DRM systems” without plugins (26). As Silverlight and Flash have become increasingly obsolete, the streaming of content using EME has become more widespread. This does not mean that opposition has dwindled. Groups continue to press the W3C and software community to reconsider the current criminalization methods for those who violate DRM protections. The question now is how heavily DRM will be incorporated into the fabric of the web as well as how to find a balance between encouraging exploration of the web and incriminating pirates of high quality content. </p>
    <h1> Overview of DRM Technology </h1>
    	<p>There are a variety of methods of implementing DRM for software. There isn’t a ubiquitous DRM standard; companies use a variety of methods to protect their content. The whole point of DRM is to combat interoperability, so if the methods behind DRM were uniform, it would be easier to circumvent. However, many companies, such as Apple, Netflix, and Valve’s Steam, use varying forms of a key system. Essentially, the key system is using serializes codes as representations of a users’ individual license to access copyrighted content. (1) A common form of key-based DRM protection for MP3 files and DVDs is content scrambling.</p>
        <p> As an example of content scrambling DRM, we will look at Apple’s Fairplay DRM system. Although Apple’s music is now DRM-Free, other content such as movies, apps, eBooks, and film, are DRM protected. Each iTunes account is associated with an encrypted key that authorizes that particular machine to access the account. Apple stores this key and accompanying account information in an “encrypted key repository”. (3) As an extra protection, an account is limited to being authorized on no more than five machines. When a user purchases content on iTunes, a user key that is specific to that file is generated. The file’s data is scrambled, and an encrypted master key is generated for the specific file. Only the master key knows how to unscrambled the file data. This master key is then locked using the user key. Only the user’s key can decrypt the master key so it can unscramble the file data so that the app, eBook, or video can be viewed. (2)
        </p>
    <h1> Details of Debate</h1>
        <p> DRM has long been a complicated and flawed tool to implement. Prior to the W3C’s decision to create an API so that EME (Encypted Media Extensions) could be streamed using HTML5, encrypted content was streamed using third-party applications and plug-ins. The complexity and lack of standardization of DRM implementation and the security issues associated with plug-ins such as Silverlight caused the W3C to take on the task of creating this API. Now all major web browsers are capable of streaming DRM protected video content. While many open source and free software groups oppose this, those in favor argue that having an interoperable standard promotes an open web for users. Though DRM has become more standard since the release of this API, there is still debate on DRM itself as well as the laws that surround it. Groups today are fighting to reduce the penalties for violators of DRM protections to protect security researchers and web users who want to tinker with code on the web.  <p>
        <p> This issue has both technological and legal aspects to it, which make a single solution difficult to find. Ultimately, legislation needs to be reconsidered regarding the penalties for DRM violations. There are many tradeoffs associated both with the choice to include DRM capability in HTML5 and with changing legislation surrounding DRM. These tradeoffs are discussed in the principles section of this paper.<p>
    	<h2> In favor of DRM </h2>
        	<p> Tim Berners-Lee and much of the W3C is in favor of standardizing EME for the web.  In 2013, steaming encrypted media content required plugs-in or third-party applications. By establishing an API for DRM systems, web browsers gained the capability to stream encrypted content. (10) By allowing encrypted content to be viewed in a web browser, “which can be open source, and available on a general purpose computer”, it takes away a need for a “special purpose box” such as plug-ins or applications and supports interoperability and an open web.  (10) <p>
            <p> In response to controversy over the W3C’s 2013 decision, Berners-Lee quoted the W3C’s HTML5 spec, which states that “In case of conflict, consider users over authors over implementors over specifiers over theoretical purity.” (8). He went on to say that in their decision to create a DRM API for HTML5 they were following this principle. He acknowledged that web users want different and sometimes conflicting things: </p>
            <p> Some Web users like to watch big-budget movies at home, some Web users like to experiment with code. The best solution will be one that satisfies all of them, and we’re still looking for that. If we can’t find that, we’re looking for the solutions that do least harm to these and other expressed wants from users, authors, implementers, and others in the ecosystem. (9)</p>
            <p> Ultimately, he concedes that this solution may not be perfect but their decision was made with the intention of providing for the needs of the users, even beyond their own personal oppositions and beliefs about DRM.</p>
            <p> Streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu have embraced DRM and abandoned Silverlight and other plugins. Prior to the development of EME standards for the web, Flash and Silverlight were targeted by malware attacks, which exposed their security weaknesses (20). After the development of these standards by the W3C, browsers adopted these standards and premium video content streaming companies, such as Netflix, have embraced EME standards in HTML5. (21) </p>
            <p> W3C Chief Executive Jeff Jaffe also wrote in favor of EME specifications for the web. He cites the need for the Web to be “capable of hosting all kinds of content and that it must be possible to compensate creative work.” (16) Without DRM, video content owners will be driven by economic goals and “their responsibilities to others” to abstain from posting media content on the Web. As a result, the web will loose an integral part of its content. Although DRM schemes are not open and not standard, the Web, in Jaffes’ opnion, has the obligation to accommodate these schemes in the best way possible. Regardless of whether or not content is free or costs money to view, Jaffe states that it is the “W3C’s overwhelming responsibility to pursue broad interoperability, so that people can share information”. (16) If the web did not support the viewing of premium content, there is a risk that this content will be only available on applications that are separate from the web or on “completely locked down devices”, which would ultimately be the worst case scenario for all users. (16) </p>
    	<h2> Opposed to DRM </h2>
        	<p> Insert text </p>
            <p> Groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Free Software Foundation (FSF) are vocal oppositionists of DRM. (17) The FSF labels systems that support DRM as “defective by design”(17). The EFF believes that DRM’s most flawed aspects transcend the technological sphere and relate instead to legislating DRM.  The anti-circumvention legislation in a variety of countries “compensate for the weaknesses of DRM’s protection model with harsh penalties for those who bypass it, even for perfectly reasonable aims.” The EFF argues even those who violate DRM protections for “lawful purposes” are considered civil or criminal offenders. This legislation has, in the opinion of the EFF, made DRM become a “black box” and a “legal booby trap” for “security researchers or those seeking to re-implement [DRM] for the purposes of interoperability” to the point where they cannot bypass or fully discuss their process of bypassing without facing legal risks. (15) They believe that the W3C’s standards for DRM would still be used against security researchers or those trying to create interoperability. </p>
            <p> The EFF also believes the EME directly contradicts the principle that the web should be open and its resources accessible to “anyone, anywhere, without permission or negotiation” (18). This group argues “EME undermines the Web's compatibility by allowing sites to demand "specific proprietary third-party software or even special hardware and particular operating systems."”(17) </p>
            <p> The Free Software Foundation is an active protestor of DRM. In March 2016, the organization orchestrated protests at the W3C against the attempts of “Netflix, Hollywood and other technology and media companies” to include DRM in web standards. (19) Some protestors entered the W3C building and were removed by police. Other than that the protests consisting of anti-DRM chants and marches outside of the W3C, Google, and Microsoft buildings in Boston. Google and Microsoft support DRM in Web standards while the W3C does not unanimously support DRM in the Web. The FSF believes that DRM in web standards will make it “cheaper and less politically costly to impose restrictions on users” and argues that DRM involved “vulnerabilities, surveillance, and curtailed freedom” (19). The FSF has directly responded to Jeffery Jaffes’ arguments for support EME on the web, claiming that the W3C is simply giving in to bullying from companies like Netflix. As a result, the FSF went so far as to urge its members to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. (21) The FSF argues that DRM and copyright enforcement are entirely unrelated. They state that “Copyright restricts who can distribute media, DRM restricts how users can access their media” (24). DRM, according to the FSF, limits authors, publishers, labels, and studios. For example, if an independent publisher wants its content to be DRM free, switching to a DRM free platform becomes difficult and not monetarily sound because it could require customers to repurchase their work on the new platform the publisher adopts (23). The FSF fears that DRM will allow companies to have ultimate control over media content. They argue that DRM consolidates the platforms on which media can be viewed, creating a monopoly and limiting the freedom of users to dictate how, when, and on what platforms they can view media (23). </p>

    <h1> Related Principles </h1>
        <h2>Metcalfe's Law</h2>
            <p> Principles we've studied in the class relate to the question of DRM for the Web.
            In many ways, DRM protections directly conflict with Metcalfe’s Law. This is because DRM limits the connections that can be made to content on the Internet. When Netflix or Amazon or Apple limits access to media using DRM protections, they are lessening the network effect of the Internet by making limiting the connections that users can make. When authors and artists alike publish work on the web, using DRM protections will limit the connections that their work could create. A book published for free online that can be shared and seen by anyone benefits the network effects of Metcalfe’s Law and also benefits the artist in that they have the potential to reach more viewers.</p>
            <p> In a variety of cases, pirated works, which are free of DRM protection, often lead to increased popularity of the work itself. A well-known benefactor of piracy is Game of Thrones, which is the most pirated show on the web today (4). HBO’s shows are not internationally available but pirated, DRM free episodes made the show accessible to audiences around the world, exponentially increasing its network connections. Metcalfe’s Law was certainly at work in this case, as word of mouth and buzz around the show helped elevate its popularity to reach audiences that were willing to pay to view the show. </p>
            <p> Piracy made the show accessible to audiences around the world. In fact, the CEO of Time Warner Jeff Bewes said in 2013 that “if you go to people who are watching it without subs, it's a tremendous word-of-mouth thing . . . We've been dealing with this for 20, 30 years—people sharing subs, running wires down the backs of apartment buildings. Our experience is that it leads to more paying subs.” Bewes then went as far as claiming that the fact that Game of Thrones is the most pirated show in the world is “better than an Emmy." (5) </p>
            <p> O’Reilly Media Company, a media publishing site for eBook and websites relating to computer science, is committed to publishing DRM-free content. In an interview with the founder and CEO of the company, Tim O’Reilly, was asked whether or not he fears piracy of the site’s content. He responded: </p>
            <p>Let’s say my goal is to sell 10,000 copies of something. And let’s say that if by putting DRM in it I sell 10,000 copies and I make my money, and if by having no DRM 100,000 copies go into circulation and I still sell 10,000 copies. Which of those is the better outcome? I think having 100,000 in circulation and selling 10,000 is way better than having just the 10,000 that are paid for and nobody else benefits. (6) </p>
            <p> These are just two examples of the benefits of publishing DRM-free content. Had Time Warner initially cracked down harder on piracy, they may not have the widespread success and popularity that the Game of Thrones currently enjoys. By limiting the networks effect of content, the content itself may have a decreased likelihood of success and exposure. </p>
            <p> Bill Gates, for example, spoke optimistically of piracy at a speech in 1998, arguing that although many users don’t pay for Microsoft software, “Someday they will, though” and “And as long as they’re going to steal it, we want them to steal ours. They’ll get sort of addicted, and then we’ll somehow figure out how to collect sometime in the next decade.” </p>
        <h2> Tradeoffs </h2>
            <p> The W3C published a list (7) of the pros and cons of supporting EME (Encrypted Media Extensions) in HTML5. We have discussed both sides of the debate and mentioned many of the listed points but it is clear that supporting EME in HTML allows encrypted movies, which were expensive to make, to be played at all, because without EME, piracy rises and film companies may be less likely to make content available online. The tradeoff is that DRM can lead to imprisonment and it negativity impacts user experience. This tradeoff relationship is largely that supporting DRM can help content producers but hurt users. </p>
    <h1>Exploitation of DRM</h1>
        <p> Even with DRM, pirates and torrenting groups are constantly trying to circumvent paying for copy protection. Since Netflix began streaming content through HTML5, it has also recently developed DRM for high-definition content, which it calls Netflix Ultra HD 4K (22). Although this high definition format is very new and not widely integrated with browsers, as Internet speed and personal computer improve in speed, this format will grow (22). In the summer of 2014, a torrenting group was able to rip this 4k content (22). </p>
        <p> In July 2015, researchers at the security company Zimperium found a vulnerability in Andriod devices that they linked the DRM processing. The researchers found multiple insecurities in the Andriod’s Stagefright media library, which allowed for “easy exploitation” and gave them “almost root-level privileges and Internet access” (24). The excessive permissions were traced back to supporting DRM protections. The devices’ support of DRM made them susceptible to “silent exploitation in the background” (24). </p>
        <p> As recently as March 2016, Apple iOS devices became victim to a malware attack that exploited flaws in Apple’s DRM software. (25) This Trojan virus, Ace Deceiver, was detected by researchers at Palo Alto Networks. While those who jailbreak their iOS devices are at risk for attacks, AceDeciver can install malware regardless. AceDeceiver uses a Man in the Middle attack (MTM), which has been previously used on Apple devices to spread pirated content, but it is the first virus that installs malware (25). </p>
    <h1> Since 2013 </h1>
        <p> In response to the outcry from the September 2013 announcement that the W3C that it would re-charter the HTML Working Group to include discussion of DRM-protected video content, Tim Berners-Lee posted on the W3C blog to address concerned parties. In it, he addressed that the HTML Working Group is working to find a solution that satisfies that largest amount of users and because users have an array of needs, there is no perfect solution. In 2014, HTML Working Group released an API so that EME content could be cleanly integrated with HTML5. (10) <p/>
        <p> In March 2016, the W3C was “considering adopting a DRM non-aggression covenant. Free Software Foundation held demonstrations in Boston, where the meeting took place. The W3C responded to the protests with an “open invitation to all people in the free-software community for genuine person-to-person dialog with people in the W3C staff about DRM on the Web”. They urged protesters to directly contact W3C members, rather than taking a photograph in front of the office as a sign of protest – the method that protestors had employed. </p>
        <p> Many companies have implemented the EME interface. </p>
